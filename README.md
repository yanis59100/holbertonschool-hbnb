# Holberton School HBNB Project

This repository contains the HBNB (AirBnB clone) project I completed during my studies at Holberton School.  
The focus of this project was to build a complete web application from scratch, applying both backend and frontend concepts in Python.

## Project Overview
- Full-stack web application simulating AirBnB functionality  
- Implements models, storage, and RESTful API endpoints  
- Console and web interface to interact with objects  
- User authentication and data persistence  

## Tech / Stack
- Python (OOP, classes, and modules)  
- Flask (for web routes and API)  
- HTML/CSS (for frontend interface)  
- MySQL (for data storage)  
- Git for version control  

## What I Learned
- Building a web application using Python and Flask  
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python  
- Working with databases and ORM concepts  
- Implementing RESTful API endpoints  
- Integrating frontend and backend components  

## Usage
Clone the repository, follow the installation instructions, and run the console or web application to explore HBNB functionalities.
